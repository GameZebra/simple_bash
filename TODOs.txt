Ideas what to do:

make a page explaining how and when you should use: 
((  ))
( )
$( )
[ ]
[[ ]] 

check the wheather bash if it still works
try to make another such scrypt which downloads info from the web
if it requires special website you can use github to host one yourself

the files should be organized in folders
and the documentation to be expanded
